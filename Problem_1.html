// Problem #1 
//Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of healthy weight.
// It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and a height in feet and inches and displays the user's BMI value. To convert the users weight in pounds to their weight in kilograms you will need to use the fact that there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram.
// 
var weight = parseFloat(prompt("What is your weight in pounds?"));
var heightFt = parseFloat(prompt("What is your weight in feet?"));
var heightIn = parseFloat(prompt("What is your height in inches?"));

var kiloWeight = (weight*0.45);
var feetConvert = (heightFt*12) + (heightIn);
var meterHeight = (feetConvert*0.0254);

var bmi = (kiloWeight/meterHeight * meterHeight);
console.log(bmi);
